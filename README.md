## Mobile Touch-Free Hand Washer for Covid-19 Prevention
*University of Bengkulu* funded a project to design and build a mobile touch-free hand washer for local need. Available hand washer in Bengkulu still requires user to touch something. We used on-the-shelf available parts to develop a version wich is mobil and touch-free. Here we will share details of or product. This work is finacially supported by Faculty of Medicine and Nursery, University of Bengkulu.
