## Mobile Touch-Free Hand Washer for Covid-19 Prevention
*University of Bengkulu* funded a project to design and build a mobile touch-free hand washer for local need. Available hand washer in Bengkulu still requires user to touch something. We used on-the-shelf available parts to develop a version which is mobile and touch-free. Here we will share details of or product. This work is financially supported by Faculty of Medicine and Nursery, University of Bengkulu. We consider our design simple, easily made and low-cost.
## Parts
We used parts that are available in Indonesia and can be purchased online. Electronics components are difficult to find in Bengkulu of similar city. However, the following parts can be purchased online.
1. Water Pump
2. Infra Red Sensors
3. Power Supply
